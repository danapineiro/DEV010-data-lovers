    <p id="info">Tarot is a set of cards used for divination and spiritual reflection. Each tarot card has unique symbolism and is believed to reveal information about a person's past, present, and future, as well as provide guidance and insights into their life.

      A tarot deck typically consists of 78 cards, divided into two main groups: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana comprises 22 cards that represent universal archetypes and concepts, such as The Fool, The Magician, The Empress, and so on. The Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards divided into four suits, similar to a traditional playing card deck, and each suit represents a specific facet of life, such as love, work, emotions, and challenges.
      
      Tarot reading involves a reader, or tarot reader, shuffling the cards and placing them in a specific pattern (or spread) to interpret their meaning in the context of the question or concern of the querent. Interpretations can be highly subjective and vary depending on the reader, but they are based on intuition, the symbolism of the cards, and the connections between them.
      
      It's important to note that tarot is considered by many people as a tool for introspection and personal reflection, rather than a precise way to predict the future. Some people find comfort, guidance, and clarity through tarot readings, while others view it as a spiritual or self-exploration practice.
      
      Tarot has a long history and has evolved over the centuries, with roots in 15th-century Europe. While some people consider it a form of divination, others see it as an art form, psychology, or spirituality. Its interpretation and use can vary widely depending on the tradition and personal beliefs of those who practice it.</p>
